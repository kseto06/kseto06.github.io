    <h3>Summary: </h3>

    <p>
        For my Praxis I design project, my Praxis team (me, Celena, Adi, and Nareen) teamed up to address an EngSci "splartz" that we
        noticed throughout our lectures and study sessions with friends; students often doze off and fall asleep due to the intense 
        workload of the Engineering Science program. Our research on various studies of sleep showed that university students  
        sleep of less than 6 hrs/night on a typical school week, with 43.3% (the most popular response) of participants ‘feeling excessive sleepiness during independent study time’. 
        Seeing this, we wanted to create a device that would help our fellow classmates stay awake and alert during lectures and study sessions.
        <!--Add reference to design report-->
        In this project, we combined physics and secondary research with engineering design concepts taught in ESC101, using the FDCR cycle to design
        our anti-sleep device.

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        We initially ideated our opportunity through observing the overall EngSci community and considering the lived experiences of our friends and classmates
        whom we observed fell asleep a lot in class. To further frame our opportunity, we conducted secondary research and unofficial surveys asking various
        friends and classmates about the average amount of sleep that they get per night on an average EngSci week to get a sense of the problem that our 
        opportunity was addressing. In the design brief, we framed the opportunity by summarizing the background and stakeholders, and then defining the requirements framework 
        to constraint our design space, using secondary research, codes and standards, and DfX's as justification for objectives. We defined our primary objective to try to get 
        the device to activate when the user's head is tilts down (i.e. at a craniovertebral angle of 45° or greater), which is an angle associated with dozing off.

        <br>
        In the diverging stage, we diverged to three main designs using various diverging tools, most notably Lotus Blossom and Morph Charts. For this opportunity,
        we found that there were many different directions that we could diverge to. In the Lotus Blossom diagram, we diverged into different "awakening" techniques that
        the final design could have, including activated sounds, applied force, lights, etc. After diverging to these different techniques, we then used Morph Charts to 
        further diverge ideas that different techniques may have (e.g: an applied force could be a hair pull or a slap), and we were able to diverge to many of our design ideas
        using this global morph chart. For example, the pulley hat was developed by selecting the pulley activation and a slap force from the diverged techniques.

        For this project, our converging process was probably the most important stage of this project's FDCR cycle, mainly because we had to converge from multiple diverged design ideas.
        Our converging heavily utilized the three main converging tools: Pairwise Comparison Matrix, Measurement Matrix, and Pugh Chart. We first used the pairwise comparison matrix 
        to converge from 5 diverged designs to 3 designs (Pulley Hat, Gear Pendulum, and Spring-Sound Necklace) through debating over the designs and relating them to how well they 
        meet our defined requirements, and then we used Measurement Matrix and Pugh Chart in reference to a reference design to converge to the pulley hat design, seeing that it performed
        the best as defined by our requirements framework, and also was the only design that never performed worse than the reference design in the Pugh Chart.

    <h3>CTMFs: </h3>

    <h4>Framing Concept/Tool: Requirements Framework </h4>
    <p>
        The requirements framework was a key framing tool that we used to help us frame our opportunity, stakeholders, goals, and define concrete, researched, and feasible requirements in a structured manner.
        Using a requirements framework also allowed us to frame stakeholder needs into structured objectives that could be prioritized from high-level to low-level. For example, in this project, we framed our opportunity and potential designs
        to follow objectives that affect the stakeholders -- us and the user. We defined objectives such as "activates during sleep" (i.e. the aforementioned craniovertebral angle objective) and safety objectives (i.e. to design a device that 
        benefits and does not harm the user) to fulfill the needs of the user stakeholder as much as possible, but we also defined requirements such as the "manually manufacturable" objective (Objective 4.2) for us/the team to ensure that we would
        be able to manufacture a fully mechanical device within our time constraints, skills, and accessibility to manufacturing devices as First-Year Engineering Science students.

        </figure>
    </div>
    <h4>Converging Tool: Pairwise Comparison Matrix </h4>
    <p>
        As mentioned previously, the Pairwise Comparison Matrix was a major converging tool in helping us converge to our final design -- specifically, it was very useful in the initial stage of our converging process, where 
        we had to converge from 5 diverged designs to 3 designs (Pulley Hat, Gear Pendulum, and Spring-Sound Necklace). The way that pairwise comparison works is simple; two members of the group prepare arguments on their design,
        and argue why they believe that their design is superior to the other design in reference to the requirements framework. Using pairwise comparison makes it obvious as to what design best follows the defined requirements and is 
        therefore better, significantly helping in the converging process. In our project, arguing on the designs using pairwise comparison allowed us to simplify from 5 designs to 3, and made the process of using Measurement Matrix and Pugh Chart
        much easier and more efficient, with less designs to have to consider.

        </figure>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Converging Tool: Measurement Matrix</h4>
        <p>
            The Measurement Matrix is a converging tool that lists a set of designs and compares them to quantitative requirements and metrics, where each of their respective metrics are obtained through proxy testing. Designs are compared to a single
            defined metric (e.g. if the metric measures length, then all design metrics are standardized to be in a common unit like meters), with each row representing respective tests for each quantitative objective. I personally found Measurement Matrices to be 
            a great, rigourous way to converge designs, as quantitative metrics are much more rigorously defined, where there is no debate or argument since quantitative metrics are either better or worse than another design. 
            In our project, we used the Measurement Matrix to help us converge from the three remaining designs from the Pairwise Comparison, where we converged to the Pulley Hat design with this design winning the most comparisons (3/5) out of all designs.
