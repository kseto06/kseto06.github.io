<h3>Summary: </h3>

<p>
    For my Praxis II design project, my Praxis team (me, Kimmy, Oscar, and Sarah) teamed up to address the issue of
    right-hooking in the City of Toronto. Right-hooking is a common type of cyclist incident that occurs in Toronto and 
    is one of the major causes of the many yearly cyclist injuries and deaths. Right-hooking occurs when a vehicle fails to 
    check a passing cyclist in their blindspot while making a right turn, resulting in the vehicle colliding with the cyclist.
    As avid cyclists, my team and I are always worried about the safety of Toronto cyclists and we wanted to tackle this opportunity.
