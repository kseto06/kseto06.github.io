    <h3>Summary: </h3>

    <p>
        For my Praxis II design project, my Praxis team (me, Kimmy, Oscar, and Sarah) teamed up to address the issue of
        right-hooking in the City of Toronto. Right-hooking is a common type of cyclist incident that occurs in Toronto and 
        is one of the major causes of the many yearly cyclist injuries and deaths. Right-hooking occurs when a vehicle fails to 
        check a passing cyclist in their blindspot while making a right turn, resulting in the vehicle colliding with the cyclist.
        As avid cyclists, my team and I are always worried about the safety of Toronto cyclists and we wanted to tackle this opportunity.
        <br><br>
        In this project, we combined engineering design concepts, machine intelligence, electrical engineering,
        and classical mechanics to develop an infrastructure-based cyclist detection camera system with 
        light activation that aims to alert drivers of incoming cyclists in their blindspot. This project 
        depended heavily on our knowledge and application of the FDCR model in order to create a high-quality,
        feasible solution that would fit the needs of the Toronto cycling community. We communicated heavily
        with the leader (Jun Nogami) of the Advocacy for Respect for Cyclists (ARC) group and had to constantly rescope and 
        reframe our community, designs, and requirements in order to create a design that benefits cyclists and also
        can be easily implemented on top of current infrastructure in Toronto.

            <strong>FINAL DESIGN: Aegisv2 (Camera + Arduino Lights)</strong>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        We initially framed our opportunity through meeting our community (ARC) to discuss their lived 
        experiences, challenges, and their needs and objectives. We learned that Nogami (leader of ARC) organizes
        ghost bike memorials to honour the lives of cyclists who have died in Toronto due to weak law enforcement and lack of driver awareness. 
        He feels tremendous emotional loss towards the lives of cyclists taken in Toronto, saying, “I remember every single one and every single name”. 
        Through this, we learnt the direct impact of ARC's organized ghost bike memorials and protests, and we were inspired to tackle 
        this opportunity to help prevent future deaths of cyclists in Toronto, specifically in right-hooking incidents.
        <!--Add reference for ARC-->

        </div>
        
        <br>
        In our Request for Proposal (RFP), we did further research into right-hooking incidents, stakeholders, and reference designs
        to design a detection system that would be able to effectively detect and warn vehicles of incoming cyclists. Through research 
        and rigorous classical mechanics calculations, we were able to design requirements and objectives that determined the required 
        distance and time to be kept between the bike and the car in order to have both objects stop in time to prevent a right-hooking collision.
        Reference designs such as existing blind spot sensors and car horns helped us diverge potential detection and alertion systems for 
        our final design. I was most involved in modeling the system and doing the physics calculations to define the requirements and objectives 
        for our Requirements Framework, where I was able to apply the knowledge that I learnt in PHY180 Classical Mechanics
        to model real-life physics scenarios.

        </div>

        <br>
        In the diverging stage, we diverged to three main designs using various diverging tools,
        most notably Lotus Blossom and Biomimicry. We developed Aegis (camera detection system), 
        Sensio (Arduino flagpole system), and Ekko (car horn sound system) as ways to detect and alert
        vehicles of incoming cyclists. Our approach to these designs were very different, with each 
        design touching on different aspects and types of engineering. I was mainly involved in developing
        Aegis, where I applied my knowledge of machine intelligence in computer vision to train a cyclist 
        detection model using YOLOv11 with transfer learning, and also explored developing fast-inference super resolution GAN models (SRGAN)
        to help with image quality upscaling for detection. The model achieves high precision values (mAP75 ~ 95%) and was able to accurately and quickly 
        detect cyclists for edge-detection (2.7ms inference times) during our validation tests.

        </div>
        
        <br>
        Upon our final meeting with the community and getting our final piece of feedback from Nogami, we learnt that designs
        implementing small-scale infrastructure changes are most desirable because it is hard to force/convince drivers and cyclists to 
        implement a solution on their own vehicles and bikes, and large-scale infrastructure changes take a long time to be implemented. 
        With this in mind, we converged to an upgraded version of Aegis, which combines Aegis detection system, and Sensio's Arduino lights to create an 
        alerting system attached beside traffic lights. The goal of the final design is to detect incoming cyclists in the bike lane and 
        use flashing lights to indicate to drivers that there is a cyclist in their blindspot to prevent the potential right-hook collision.

    <h4>Framing Concept/Tool: Reference Designs </h4>
    <p>
        In this project, when it came to framing, we used a large variety of reference designs for current detection and activation systems
        to help us define feasible, reliable, and high-level concrete objectives for possible designs. For example, the main source of
        inspiration behind Aegis and Sensio came from existing reference designs that we researched, such
        as the universal blind spot assist systems on cars, and the blind spot cameras and detection systems on the Tesla Model 3.
        <br>
        With these reference designs, we were able to design prototypes that adapts these existing designs into 
        systems that would solve the issue presented in our opporutnity. Additionally, we were also able to
        effectively use these reference designs to diverge designs that work on their current issues.
        for example, the Tesla Model 3's blind spot detection system is sometimes unreliable and is very expensive,
        and Blind Spot Assist systems are not effective in detecting small-bodies such as cyclists, so Aegis attempts to 
        work on both of these pitfalls by using a detection system that works on a small, affordable webcam camera.
        <br>
        Reference designs were very prominent in our project, and they taught me how taking past designs and adapting them to
        solve framed issues is very helpful in efficiently diverging designs and solutions.

    <h4>Diverging Tool: Lotus Blossom </h4>
    <p>
        In the diverging stage of our project, we used the Lotus Blossom to help us diverge various designs and ideas. Starting from a central goal
        of improving driver awareness, we were able to branch out and diverge into Sound, Sight, and Touch categories to appeal to human senses which
        we felt would best increase driver awareness. Lotus blossom allowed us to diverge into various solution spaces and design ideas which all met our 
        defined requirements. This allowed us to explore many ideas that we would not have thought of if we had only used basic brainstorming and mind-mapping.

    <div style="position: relative; top: -50px;">
        <h4>Diverging Tool: Biomimicry</h4>
        <p>
            The diverging stage of this project also heavily depended on our use of biomimicry. In particular, we used biomimicry 
            to help us diverge more design ideas using the three senses that we diverged to in Lotus Blossom, mainly focusing on 
            animals and entities in nature that exert these effects. For example, Ekko was inspired by howling wolves and sound-amplifying seashells,
            Sensio was inspired by ultrasonic sensors and detection in dolphins and bats, and Aegis was inspired by the wide-range vision in frogs.
            Overall, I learned that biomimicry was an effective tool in diverging, and was also effective in refining ideas generated in Lotus Blossom.
