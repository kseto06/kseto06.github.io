    <h3>Summary: </h3>

    <p>
        For my CIV102 bridge project, my team and I (me, John, Ryan, Alisha) optimized and designed a
        bridge with the goal of carrying 400+ N point loads. We combined engineering design and applied structural engineering concepts
        to design, calculate, and build our optimized bridge design. Throughout the project, we applied the FDCR cycle 
        to frame our objectives for the final bridge product and applied structural engineering concepts to diverge and converge 
        multiple designs.

    <p>
        To start the project, we made sure to thoroughly understand our given problem statement through completing the initial deliverable assignment. 
        Although the goal of simply building a bridge to support a load seems simple -- it was quite complicated to frame the problem at hand and define
        specific requirements and objectives for our bridge. For example, we had limitations on the materials we could use, and there were many structural 
        engineering problems that we had to consider for the bridge design, such as the bending moment and shear force experienced by the bridge from the point 
        loads. As such, we had to reframe the problem statement to move more towards <b>iteratively optimizing the bridge design</b> and being able to develop
        a <b>visualization tool</b> that could help us visualize where the bridge fails in certain areas to help us iteratively improve our design.

        <br>
        For the diverging process, we took an unconventional approach. Since the bridge was already very complicated to model, especially
        with multiple types of failures/formulas to keep in mind, we decided not to use usual diverging methods such as Lotus Blossom or Biomimicry to 
        generate more ideas. Instead, we took an <b>iterative development</b> approach to our design, where we decided to start with a single base design (called "Design Zero" and was provided by the CIV102 Teaching Team),
        and improve the design with better optimizations through each iteration. In other words, we used the <b>Modify</b> technique of the SCAMPER Model.
        Through each iteration, we were able to optimize the bridge against each of the stresses presented in the formulas above, thus making the bridge theoretically
        as strong as possible. Throughout this process, we developed code in MATLAB and Python to help us calculate and visualize the effect that the bridge iterations had to see
        where the bridge was failing and how we could improve it.

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">
            <img src="/images/praxis/civ/bridge-graphs.png" alt="civ bridge graphs" style="max-width: 95%; height: auto;">
        </div>
        
        <br>
        On the final iteration, we converged to the design that we felt best optimized our bridge's performance. Because we took a "baseline design" approach
        to the project, we did not need to use usual converging techniques such as the Pugh Chart or the Pairwise Comparison Matrix to choose on the best design.
        Instead, we only needed to take our fully optimized design, measure out and cut the matboard pieces, and assemble the bridge.
        <br>
        During testing, the bridge was unsuccessful in carrying the 400+ N load, only being able to carry a few objects (~3 N) total before failure. The bridge had buckled 
        quickly before hand due to insufficient gluing at the center connection point. Additionally, we had cut the bridge in the center, which was a mistake as the bending 
        moment was largest there (i.e. the bridge has the weakest support there, and we increased the chance of failure by making the cut in the center). However, this was a 
        good learning experience to learn more about structural engineering concepts and how we should pay more attention to visual plots and graphs when designing the bridge 
        to best minimize failure in the real-life design, and not just in theoretical calculations.

    <h3>CTMFs: </h3>

    <h4>Represent Model: Hoover Dam Model</h4>
    <p>
        The Hoover Dam Model is a model that shows the relationship between reality (technology) and theory (science and math). In 
        the process of framing the problem and building the bridge, my team and I implicitly used the Hoover Dam model to frame and represent our project.
        For example, we used mathematical and structural engineering concepts (theory) to perceive the bridge design and how well it was doing during 
        each iteration, while having the dream/goal of being able to support the 400N load of the train -- iteratively looping through the theory stage of the Hoover Dam model.
        Once we converged to what we thought was an optimized, theoretical design we then shifted to the Reality stage, building and creating the theoretical world that we have 
        converged to.

    <h4>Diverging Tool: SCAMPER Modify</h4>
    <p>
        In the SCAMPER Model, the 'M' stands for Modify, which describes the process of exploring different ways to 
        improve an existing product or design by adding changes and iterating upon the current design. In this project, we heavily 
        depended on the use of Modifying existing iterations to improve the bridge design, as this tool was much more efficient than usual diverging tools 
        to improve the bridge design. By taking these concept from the SCAMPER model and applying them to each design iteration,
        we were able to improve upon one or more of the bridge's properties to make a design that performs best.

        <h4>Converging Concept: Prototyping</h4>
        <p>
            Prototyping involves introducing a model to generate or communicate information about a design. In this project, 
            as we were slowly diverging and converging to our final design through modifying our bridge design, we created mathematical prototypes
            and graphs to model the various forces and stresses that the bridge would experience whenever we made a change in certain iterations. This was a very useful tool to help us visualize
            the possible failures that the bridge would be subject to and when they would happen. Using mathematical prototypes such as graphs and mathematical equations allowed us to easily 
            model the bridge's performance to better optimize the design.
