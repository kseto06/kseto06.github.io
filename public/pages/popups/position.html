    <h4><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h4>

    <p>
        To establish my current position in context, I iterate on my position statement that I created in January. 
        Overall, after reflecting on the principles, values, and beliefs that I discussed back then, I found that
        my overall position has remained the same, but it has been refined and reinforced by the projects that I have been able to take on since then.
        In accordance to my previous position statement, I will discuss my position under the two main categories that I previously presented: my <u>Approach</u> and my <u>Values & Beliefs</u>, and how my <u>Experiences</u> throughout this past semester has informed and influenced them.
    </p>

        <span style="display: inline;"><h4><b><u>Approach</u></b></h4></span>
    </a>

    <p>
        Previously, in my position statement, I defined engineering as "the technical knowledge used such as math and sciences to apply them to solve real-life problems",
        design as "the general formulation of requirements to solve a problem", and engineering design as combining both concepts presented by engineering and design and combining them to "effectively define and technically solve the problem".
        I still believe that this is a good definition of engineering design, but my approach to engineering design has evolved from just this definition to a much grander vision. Throughout this semester, I participated in a full design project in Praxis II
        to communicate with a community, leading UTMIST's (University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team) first-ever tournament (AI Squared / AI^2) for over 400 participants, and organizing and leading the Application Review committee (25+ committee members with ~1400 applicants) for the GenAI Genesis Hackathon (Canada's Largest AI Hackathon),
        where I have gained valuable experience in engineering design and collaboration to achieve an ultimate goal. 
        <br><br>
        These experiences have further reinforced my approach to engineering design where I am applied technical knowledge and design principles to face various challenges. For example, in the AI^2 tournament I applied knowledge learned from previous coursework such as 
        Machine Learning Specialization and ESC180/190 to develop a codebase for the tournament, and I applied design principles where I used the Requirements framework to organize goals for the tournament with deadlines to complete different components of the project.
        However, my approach to engineering design has evolved in the way that I now see engineering design as a collaborative and communicative process as well. Previously, many of my the projects that I have tackled are usually personal projects or projects with a very little number of stakeholders.
        The projects that I have tackled this semester allowed me to gain experience in communicating with communities and carefully considering the needs of many stakeholders as I began to deal with a much larger number. Having been in more leadership experiences, I have become a more collaborative engineer,
        where I worked with various teams to solve a large issue. Overall, my approach to engineering design has stayed the same, but has evolved to be more collaborative.

        style="display: inline-block;">
        <span style="display: inline;"><h4><b><u>Values & Beliefs</u></b></h4></span>
    </a>

    <p>
        My position statement stated that my main two beliefs are that <b><u>failure is part of the learning process</u></b> and <b><u>collaboration allows for better outcomes and opportunities</u></b>. I still believe that my overall position towards this has not changed, 
        and my experiences throughout the semester has only reinforced my previous values and beliefs, as informed by my new experiences. 
        <br><br>
        For example, I have continued to learn and improve upon myself only through failure. I continue to sincerely believe that without struggle and failure, we cannot learn anything meaningful -- as this would imply that we already know how to tackle any problem.
        Through my failures and struggles throughout the projects and roles I have tackled this semester, I have improved on myself as an aspiring ML/AI engineer and leader. During the Praxis II project, I highly struggled in figuring out the process of training the computer vision model for my team's project, 
        but perseverance and sheer will to get the model done is ultimately a major factor in what carried me through, and allowed me to learn new and fundamental concepts in computer vision and deep learning. 
        <br><br>
        I have also further reinforced my belief that collaboration allows for better outcomes and opportunities. As mentioned previously, I have had the opportunity to work with three different teams to develop designs that would benefit a community and in total 1700+ stakeholders. 
        However, none of this would have been possible without collaboration and a great team as it is impossible for me, alone, to be able to diverge designs ideas by myself and organize entire events. For all of my past opportunities that I have worked on this semester, collaboration was key to even allow for any outcomes to be possible.
        <br><br>
        My two main values mentioned in my position statement are upholding <b><u>quality</u></b> and <b><u>integrity</u></b>. I continue to believe that these two values are most important to me as an aspiring engineer, and I have continued to uphold these values in my opportunities.
        Since I have been engaged in opportunities that affect many stakeholders, upholding quality is a value that holds much meaning to me as an aspiring engineer, as I aim to ensure that all stakeholders needs are met and designs are satisfactory and of high-quality to all stakeholders.
        For example, in my Praxis II project, we were constantly reframing our project requirements and rescoping diverged design ideas based on feedback of our community to best meet their needs. 
        I also continue to believe that integrity is an important value to uphold as an aspiring AI engineer. Currently, AI can be used in many harmful ways such as using generative AI to generate controversial images and deepfakes.
        One of my most important values as an engineer is to uphold integrity and create designs for the sole purpose of benefiting stakeholders, where we define stricter requirements that ensure designs cannot be manipulated where they could be used for malicious or harmful purposes.
